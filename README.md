# County-level data on agricultural adaptation to climate change

The [compiled data](/data/output) are stored as four CSV files with different tabular formats:
- A [metadata file](/data/output/variables.csv) documenting the names, units, and descriptions for the variables covered in the other files.
- Time series data. This includes data from the NASS Ag Census and the American Community Survey, for 2012 and 2017.
- Static data. This comprises values that don't change over time, including data on soil properities and land grant universities.
- Climate data. There are several hundred climate data points per county, derived from daily climate data, representing different variables, statistics, and time periods.

A more detailed but still incomplete description of methods currently lives [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/106Y8kmaxUmF0cx2UnIoyItj8UoCE8tMA3zYd8-AHZfw/edit?usp=sharing).
